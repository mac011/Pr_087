    "Potholes have been a major issue within the city of San Diego for years; recently the city has asked its residents to begin reporting potholes in order to have the problem dealt with in a swifter manner, revealing how large of an issue it truly is. Despite this effort to raise awareness, potholes are still a prevalent problem to the residents of San Diego, and the city is considered to have one of the worst road conditions in the United States. According to Pothole.info, poor road conditions cause at least a third of fatal traffic accidents a year, explaining why San Diego should be allocating more resources into dealing with this problem.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Fixmystreet.com claims that causes of potholes range from rainy weather conditions to heavy vehicle presence. If there is a correlation with bus transit routes and the percentage of potholes, it would be in the best interest of the city to focus on these potholes because of the economic benefits it can bring; potholes can damages busses and also endanger the passengers in them.  Aside from this, there may also be some correlations with the proportion of potholes and the surrounding socio-economic area. In order to make roads safer, the city of San Diego should prioritize on fixing potholes in neighborhoods that are less affluent. Lastly, our group was curious to see if there was a relationship with how much a parking meter makes with respect to the amount of potholes located around the meters. If a meter is less profitable when there are more potholes, it would be in the best interest for the city to focus on repairing these potholes in order to bring in funds. These are the several problems our groups believes are potentially caused by the presence of potholes and that we hope to address through our project. \n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",

    "The data we have is fairly clean, but we need to filter out several rows and columns to retain only the relevant data.

    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall analysis of the relationships between the location of potholes, traffic meters, and bus transit stops can be observed to discover possible correlations between the different datasets. Analysis of the pothole frequency and locations from the “Get it Done Requests” dataset can be plotted using longitude and latitude onto the SANDAG GIS program to visually map the potholes onto a detailed San Diego map. Darker areas on the map will indicate denser clusters of potholes in a particular area. Similarly, traffic meter locations can be clustered onto the map to allow comparisons to be made to the pothole locations. “Traffic Meter Transactions” will be placed into a linear regression model to help determine possible patterns between highest grossing parking meters and more socio-economically advantageous areas. Depending on the variance of potholes to each meter, we can pair it to the revenue raised for each meter to analyze the possible effects of potholes depressing economic advancement. We also plan on creating a linear regression model with the socio-economic status of a neighborhood and the number of potholes each neighborhood has. This would allow us to see if there is some correlation between the frequency of potholes and the average income of a certain neighborhood. The bus transit stops will also utilize the cluster and variance method to determine if there are any potholes near the transit stops. We would then be able to determine whether there is a larger occurrence of potholes near these stops. We want to propose an emphasis to prioritize repairing of potholes surrounding transit stations, because potholes will not only inflict costly damages to public transit vehicles but endanger the lives of civilians. \n",
    "Primarily, most of the data will be analyzed spatially-wise in correlation to each dimension. We will look at the overall distribution of data, and how they compare with one another. In the case that any outliers or abnormalities are detected in the datasets, they will be closely examined and possibly dropped if necessary.\n",

Visually, the number of potholes and their relationship with rent prices of a city and the amount of transactions at a parking meter will be shown through linear regression graphs. As for the relationship between the number of potholes with parking meter locations and bus transit stops, it will be shown through cluster/variance relationships. As a result of these deliverables, it will reveal the strength and validity of their correlations. \n",

    "Some pitfalls that may occur in our project can be due to the limitations in our data sets. Potential confounds in the “Get it Done Requests” data file, for example, includes the fact that it does not indicate the size of the pothole. It is possible that for society to be actually affected by potholes, they need to be bigger and more obstructive, but the data set does not characterize them any further than just calling them “potholes” so this missing information can influence our interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally our analysis and interpretations may be confounded by the “Zillow Rent prices” data. This data set is limited with the amount of locations available. It merely indicates the median rent prices of certain specific cities, so it is a general data set that does not hone in on many specific locations and their rent prices. Rent prices are also not the most precise way to indicate the socio-economic status of an area so that can affect our accuracy when determining a city’s socio-economic status relationship with potholes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential confound deals with the methods. The GSI we want to incorporate comes in shape files that may be difficult to work with. The SANDAG website plots preexisting data onto a map, however, we were unsuccessful in extracting the raw data files from the website. Ideally, we would analyze the raw data files separately and compare that data to our other data sets. We will continue to attempt the extraction of GIS data, however, as of now, our attempts are futile.  "
